Expected performance
====

Show the expected performance about using the time granula corrections 
w.r.t. keeping the corrections set to a constant value
(e.g. beginning of fill, although it can be also worse)

Show the expected performance using the corrections made with `lumi_inst` 
and `lumi_in_fill` data; show derivative distribution and compute its variance.
